# The Collapse Website
A Simple HTML/CSS/JS Website

Was a university project to create a website on any topic
- Has multiple linked pages
- Has a clear navbar and homepage
- Has HTML5 elements
- Has Jquery Advanced element such as cookie storing and geo-location

Not got a proper commit history because it was moved from a uni storage and just uploaded to my github
